# CyclicPGS
Co-simulation of indicator functions with truncated Gaussian functions

This code simulates facies models with cyclicity, rhythmicity and diagenesis, according to the paper Le Blevec et al. (2017) Geostatistical modeling of cyclic depositional facies and diagenesis, EarthArxiv

You can find here the datasets and the functions building the Earth models.

The main files are:

main_latemar.Rmd which builds Earth models of the Latemar platform based on the dataset of Peterhansel and Egenhoff (2008).

main_bookcliff.Rmd which builds Earth models of the Bookcliff outcrop based on the dataset of Taylor et al. (2004).
