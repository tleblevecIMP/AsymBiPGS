# CyclicPGS
Co-simulation of indicator functions with truncated Gaussian functions

This code simulates facies models with cyclicity, rhythmicity and diagenesis, according to the paper Le Blevec et al. (2017) Geostatistical modeling of cyclic depositional facies and diagenesis, EarthArxiv

You can find here the datasets and the functions building the Earth models.
